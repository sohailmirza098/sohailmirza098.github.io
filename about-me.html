                    <h1>Sohail Mirza</h1>
                    <p>
                        As an Engineer, I want to help people overcome fuzzy human protocols and leverage technology to
                        make the world a better place. I posit that process kills efficiency and simple is always
                        better. I code, write, read, speak, learn and listen. Most of all, I am as passionate about my
                        craft today as I was when I wrote my first line of code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a leader, I believe that every person has the power to change the world if they have a
                        positive attitude, an open, optimistic mind, and a desire to thrive to succeed. I strongly
                        believe in kindness, respect, integrity and transparency, and empowering those around me to be
                        their best and support them to achieve their dreams. I believe that we grow in this world by
                        helping each other.
